# december submission

things i have completed from my requirements:
Upload .mp3 or .wav files from an external directory into python. This may be done using the pydub library, in order to retrieve and manipulate audio files.
Be able to identify the bitrate and kbps of the sample.
Be able to access the data of the song using a spectrogram. This can be done with python libraries, such as librosa.
Be able to split the sample track into segments. It is most likely to work when identifying a genre when the drums, chords, instruments stay constant in that particular. For example, if the song progresses into the break, the sounds may soften, which may cause inaccuracies in the program as it may think it is a different genre.
set up the keras table.


most of my code right now is in the B table, but i hope
